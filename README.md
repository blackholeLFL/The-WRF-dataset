# The-WRF-dataset

This repository shares the WRF dataset and its variants, the WRF-C dataset and the WRF-P dataset. 
The WRF dataset includes all-weather road conditions which can be used for road state classification and friction coeffiecient estimation.

The WRF-C dataset is a road status classification dataset covering various imaging perturbations in real traffic scenes. And the WRF-P dataset is another challenging pixel-level friction coefficient estimation dataset based on images from the WRF dataset. Corresponding papers will be available online soon.
